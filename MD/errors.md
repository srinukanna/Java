⚠️ Error 1: error: remote origin already exists

💡 What it means:
You already added a remote named origin. Trying to add it again causes a conflict.

✅ Fix:
You can skip adding the remote again OR reset it like this:

git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/srinukanna/Java

⚠️ Error 2: error: src refspec main does not match any

💡 What it means:
You’re trying to push a branch called main, but your local Git doesn’t have a branch with that name yet.

✅ Fix:
You probably haven't made a commit yet (so no branch is created), or your branch is still named master.

✅ FULL FIX: Do this step-by-step

# Step 1: Initialize Git (if not already)
git init

# Step 2: Check current branch name
git branch
If the output is:

* master
Then you are on master, not main.

You can:

# Step 3: Rename master to main
git branch -M main
Now make sure you have something to commit:

# Step 4: Stage files and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
Now link (or fix) the remote if needed:

# Step 5: Fix remote if already exists
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/srinukanna/Java
Finally, push to GitHub:

# Step 6: Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
✅ After This: Everything should work!
🧠 Summary of Key Points

Problem	Fix
Remote already exists	git remote remove origin then add again
Branch main doesn't exist	git branch -M main after creating a commit
No commits yet	git commit -m "message" before pushing
